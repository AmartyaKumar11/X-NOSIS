# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Patient Health Management System in X-NOSIS. The system will allow users to create organized patient directories with structured document management, enabling healthcare professionals and medical students to maintain complete patient health records with categorized document storage and analysis capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to create patient directories, so that I can organize all medical documents and records for each patient in a structured manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the patient management section THEN I SHALL see an option to create new patient directories
2. WHEN I create a new patient THEN I SHALL provide patient name and basic information
3. WHEN a patient directory is created THEN it SHALL appear in the patient list with proper organization
4. WHEN I view a patient directory THEN I SHALL see all associated documents and subdirectories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to create organized sections within each patient directory, so that I can categorize different types of medical documents appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a patient directory THEN the system SHALL automatically create default sections (Imaging, Lab Reports, Follow-ups, Clinical Notes)
2. WHEN I access a patient directory THEN I SHALL see all available document categories with the ability to create custom ones
3. WHEN I need specific organization THEN I SHALL be able to create custom subdirectories like "Lipid Profile", "Urine Analysis", "Blood Work", "Radiology", "Cardiology", "Pathology Reports"
4. WHEN I create custom subdirectories THEN I SHALL be able to name them according to medical specialties or test types
5. WHEN I organize documents THEN each section and subdirectory SHALL maintain its own file structure and analysis history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to upload and analyze documents within specific patient sections, so that I can maintain organized medical records with AI-powered insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a patient section THEN I SHALL be able to upload relevant medical documents
2. WHEN I upload documents to a patient section THEN they SHALL be analyzed using the existing AI system
3. WHEN documents are analyzed THEN the results SHALL be stored within the patient's record
4. WHEN I view patient documents THEN I SHALL see both the original files and their AI analysis results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to navigate between patients and their document sections easily, so that I can efficiently manage multiple patient records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the patient management system THEN I SHALL see a clear navigation structure
2. WHEN I browse patient directories THEN I SHALL see patient names, creation dates, and document counts
3. WHEN I navigate within a patient directory THEN I SHALL have breadcrumb navigation to track my location
4. WHEN I switch between patients THEN the interface SHALL maintain consistent styling and functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to search and filter patient records, so that I can quickly find specific patients or documents when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to find a patient THEN I SHALL be able to search by patient name
2. WHEN I search for documents THEN I SHALL be able to filter by document type or section
3. WHEN I view search results THEN they SHALL be clearly organized and easy to navigate
4. WHEN I access found items THEN they SHALL open in their proper context within the patient directory

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to create and manage custom subdirectories with medical categories, so that I can organize documents according to specific medical specialties and test types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need specialized organization THEN I SHALL be able to create custom subdirectories with names like "Lipid Profile", "CBC", "Liver Function", "Kidney Function", "Thyroid Panel"
2. WHEN I create imaging subdirectories THEN I SHALL be able to organize by type like "X-Ray", "MRI", "CT Scan", "Ultrasound", "ECG"
3. WHEN I create specialty subdirectories THEN I SHALL be able to organize by department like "Cardiology", "Neurology", "Orthopedics", "Dermatology"
4. WHEN I manage subdirectories THEN I SHALL be able to rename, delete, or reorganize them as needed
5. WHEN I create subdirectories THEN the system SHALL suggest common medical categories based on the parent section
6. WHEN I need completely custom organization THEN I SHALL be able to create any subdirectory with any name I choose (not limited to suggestions)
7. WHEN I create custom subdirectories THEN I SHALL be able to nest them multiple levels deep for complex organization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the patient management system to use the same visual design as the rest of X-NOSIS, so that I have a consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the patient management system THEN it SHALL use the same color scheme and styling as other X-NOSIS pages
2. WHEN I interact with patient directories THEN they SHALL use consistent card layouts and hover effects
3. WHEN I navigate the system THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing sidebar and navigation
4. WHEN I view patient information THEN it SHALL follow the same typography and spacing standards
