# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive Patient Health Management System in X-NOSIS. The system will allow users to create patient directories, organize medical documents into categorized folders, create sub-directories, and maintain a complete digital health record for each patient. The interface will maintain consistency with the existing X-NOSIS theme and design language.

2. WHEN I create sub-directories THEN I SHALL be able to name them and organize them hierarchically

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am in the patient management system THEN I SHALL see a search functionality
2. WHEN I search for patients THEN I SHALL be able to search by name, ID, or other criteria
3. WHEN I search within a patient directory THEN I SHALL be able to find specific documents or folders
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL highlight relevant matches and provide quick navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to view patient timelines and document history, so that I can track the patient's medical journey over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria
