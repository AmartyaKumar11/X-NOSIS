# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing free, open-source AI models for the Diagnostic Intelligence Platform (DIP) in X-NOSIS. The goal is to create a comprehensive medical analysis system using Bio_ClinicalBERT for text analysis, CheXNet for chest X-ray analysis, and free medical databases for safety validation, all targeted at medical students and junior doctors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want to upload medical reports and get AI-powered text analysis, so that I can learn to identify key medical findings and understand diagnostic patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a medical text report THEN the system SHALL extract and analyze medical entities using Bio_ClinicalBERT
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display structured findings including symptoms, conditions, and medications
3. WHEN medical entities are identified THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for each finding
4. WHEN the analysis includes medications THEN the system SHALL highlight potential drug interactions and contraindications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want to upload chest X-ray images and receive AI analysis, so that I can learn to identify pathologies and improve my diagnostic skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a chest X-ray image THEN the system SHALL analyze it using CheXNet model for pathology detection
2. WHEN pathologies are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight abnormal regions on the image
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a ranked list of potential conditions with confidence scores
4. WHEN multiple pathologies are possible THEN the system SHALL display differential diagnosis options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want the AI to provide safety alerts and drug interaction warnings, so that I can learn about medication safety and contraindications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN medications are identified in reports THEN the system SHALL check for drug interactions using free medical databases
2. WHEN contraindications are found THEN the system SHALL display clear safety warnings with explanations
3. WHEN patient history includes allergies or conditions THEN the system SHALL flag potentially dangerous medication combinations
4. WHEN safety alerts are shown THEN the system SHALL provide educational information about why the interaction is dangerous

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want to receive structured diagnostic suggestions with explanations, so that I can understand the reasoning behind medical diagnoses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate differential diagnosis suggestions based on findings
2. WHEN diagnoses are suggested THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step reasoning for each possibility
3. WHEN confidence scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL explain factors that increase or decrease diagnostic certainty
4. WHEN similar cases exist THEN the system SHALL reference comparable medical cases for learning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI models to be fast and reliable, so that users get timely responses and the system can handle multiple concurrent analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the analysis SHALL complete within 10 seconds for text and 15 seconds for images
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the models SHALL handle concurrent requests without significant performance degradation
3. WHEN models fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling with informative messages
4. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators to users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a medical student, I want to track my diagnostic accuracy over time, so that I can monitor my learning progress and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with diagnostic suggestions THEN the system SHALL track their responses and accuracy
2. WHEN diagnostic sessions are completed THEN the system SHALL store performance metrics for progress tracking
3. WHEN users view their progress THEN the system SHALL display accuracy trends and improvement areas
4. WHEN learning gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL recommend specific topics or cases for further study
